                    Hello! I am Maeve. I am a aspiring front end developer who is on a journey
                    learning HTML and CSS to get the basics of from scratch web designing and
                    creation, down. After I get that down I will start learning javascript
                    and a framework for it to begin working on the back end. When that is done,
                    I will start working with fullstack and look for a job in web development.
                    I will also begin learning another programming language, like C, for
                    network programming. If you want to find out more about me or maybe follow
                    my journey to become a fullstack developer, you can click one of the links
                    on the right. That includes if you also want to see my other hobby which is
                    simracing.
