# personal-website
This source code is for my personal website I am creating. I would love to get help from anyone
who is willing to share their knowledge in how I can better my code and make my website look
much better than it is does now. Right now I only know alittle bit of HTML and CSS. I am soon going
to learn JavaScript when I have got comfortable with HTML and CSS. I am gonna learn more backend
development, then move over to do fullstack and have a framework to get efficient with.
