                    <h2>Day 5 Learning how to code</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is day 5 learning how to code. I started off with The Odin Project
                        which set me up GitHub and then I started building a recipe Project
                        they told me to make and then I fiddled around with that.
                        Then I started with this web page at day 4 and finished the main pages.
                        Now I just gotta get the  contribution, and sim racing game pages setup.
                        It feels unrealistic how far I already come. Also really cool!
                        Maybe around day 10 I will learn how to program in JavaScript and start
                        the back end development journey and work on my web page more?

                <article>
                    <h2>Main Pages Finished!</h2>
                    <p>
                        I finally finished the main pages for the website! It feels awesome!
                        I finally can relax alittle and not feel stressed about finishing this
                        website. The website will recieve updates when possible.
                        I will continue with my learning process and also later learn the
                        flexbox/item stuff as well! But as I have said, you can contribute
                        information and code with explanation to me so I can make this website
                        better and get more knowledge so that the future websites I make is already
                        looking better than they did when I began in the beginning.
