                    <p>
                        Hello! I am Maeve. I am a aspiring front end developer who is on a journey
                        learning HTML and CSS to get the basics of from scratch web designing and
                        creation, down. I am currently working on learning C as well which will be the
                        back end for my website. C is my main language and it was to be replaced but, did not
                        when I found a fantastic source which made me stick to C. My journey from front end,
                        to fullstack has started now when I have begun learning C.
                        I also do other things than just program. I also love simracing and doing that on the side,
                        after a long session, programming. So if you like that as well, or interested you can check
                        out the simracing section of my website.

                        Possible Questions
                    </h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Why C, for the back end?</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        C is a language that I was drawn by in the early to mid part of 2021 when
                        I built my first computer. My best friend who was on a journey on learning
                        what Linux was, dragged me into it as well and I started researching myself.
                        During the same time my friend decided to teach me some programming.
                        I did have a fixed mindset back then, but it changed the more my friend helped
                        pushing me over to the growth mindset. I started also watching videos of Linus
                        Torvalds where he did some speaking on events and interviews. Both Linus and
                        my best friend pushed me to actually for real starting to program. So here I am
                        now. Learning C because I love the concept of controlling the computer with
                        its low level capabilities and the fact you can build almost anything with it.
                        I also plan on learning Assembly because I really want to become a low level pro.
                        I know there are much easier programming languages to use for the back end, but
                        this is my personal website. This is a website I experiment with and do personal
                        changes to increase my skills and also make my website fancier. I do know though,
                        that my website could become slow and bloated because of my experimentation.
